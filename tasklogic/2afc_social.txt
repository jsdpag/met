% Two-alternative forced choice with social influence task logic.
% The main difference with 2afc.txt is the addition of a social
% advice state and advisor stimulus. Supports classic version with
% a fixed test stimulus presentation period followed by choice
% targets, a purely reaction-time version of the task, or a
% combination.  Change the timeout durations to vary between versions.
% Note that reactime, the reaction time state, keeps the fixation
% stimulus ; however, a stimulus event can be connected to reactim
% that changes some property of the linked stimulus definition, to
% tell the subject that they may respond.

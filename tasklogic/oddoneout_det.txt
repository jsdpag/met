% Odd-one-out task. Supports fixed-presentation or reaction-time versions
% of the task, or a combination of both. This can be varied by changing the
% timeout duration of the 'present' state. This is designed for deterministic
% stimuli by using a separate set of task stimulus labels on the reactim state
% than the presentation state.

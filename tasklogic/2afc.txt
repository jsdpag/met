% Two-alternative forced choice task logic. Supports classic version with a
% fixed test stimulus presentation period followed by choice targets, a
% purely reaction-time version of the task, or a combination. Change the
% timeout durations to vary between versions. Note that reactime, the
% reaction time state, keeps the fixation stimulus ; however, a stimulus
% event can be connected to reactim that changes some property of the 
% linked stimulus definition, to tell the subject that they may respond.

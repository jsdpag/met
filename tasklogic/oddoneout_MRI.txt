% Odd-one-out task. Supports fixed-presentation or reaction-time versions
% of the task, or a combination of both. This can be varied by changing the
% timeout duration of the 'present' state. Note that reactime, the reaction
% time state, presents the fixation stimulus ; however, a stimulus event
% i.e. sevent can be connected to reactim that changes some property of the
% stimulus definition that is linked to fix, to signal to the subject that
% a response is allowed.

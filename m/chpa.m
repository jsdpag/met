% Matlab Electrophysiology Toolbox mex utility function. Check pointer/
% address. Returns char array s containing a string version of the memory
% address where the real-number data for array x is stored. If no return
% argument is requested, then the address is printed to Matlab's command
% terminal.
% 
% This can be a handy tool to check things such as the copy-on-write
% behaviour of Matlab.
